# Building a a Minimum Spannig Three in R, based on a Correlation Matrix
The code builds a MST (Minimum Spanning Three) network in R,  based on a distance correlation matrix. This is a step-by-step procedure from the tidy data to the MST table csv file: it measures the correlation matrix and the distance correlation matrix; calculates de p-values for all correlations; builds a MST and aftear that, transform the vertices and links data into a three columns data set (MST.csv).
